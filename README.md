# Image Processing Assignment

This project is an image processing assignment I completed to improve my Python programming skills. It includes a set of functions to analyze and manipulate images, and it was created as part of a learning exercise.

## Overview

The project consists of the following components:

1. **Image Analysis Functions**:
   - `get_image_dimensions(image_path)`: Returns the dimensions (width, height) of an image.
   - `get_mean_color(image_path)`: Returns the mean color (mean R, mean G, mean B) of an image.
   - `mean_color_square(img, x_0, y_0, width, height)`: Returns the mean color of a specified section of an image.

2. **Image Visualization Function**:
   - `image_of_avgs(image_path, num_x, num_y)`: Generates a new image containing the mean color values in a grid of squares within the input image.

## Usage

To run the code, use the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python image_main.py <image_path>

## Dependencies
This project uses the following Python libraries:

Pillow (PIL Fork): Used for image processing.

## Acknowledgments
This project was created as part of a Python programming assignment to improve my skills. It serves as a valuable learning exercise for image processing and Python programming.

Feel free to explore, use, and modify this code for your own learning purposes or image processing needs.
